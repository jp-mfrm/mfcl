    </Typography>
    <Typography variant='byline'>
      byline - Hello World
    </Typography>
  </Component>
</Playground>

### Pass a Custom Tag to the Component
You may want the h1 variant, but you already have an h1 on the page, 
so you're able to pass a tag with the tag prop. 

- For example, turn an h2 variant into a p tag. 

<Playground>
  <Typography variant='h2' tag='p'>
    This is the h2 variant but rendered as a p tag instead!
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant='price-sale' tag='a' href='/'>
    This is the price-sale variant but rendered as an a tag instead!
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant='paragraph-lg' tag='h3' className='veryGreen' style={{color: 'green'}}>
    This is the paragraph-lg variant but rendered as an h3 tag instead! Also with a custom className and styling.
  </Typography>
</Playground>

### Align the text with the align prop

<Playground>
  <Typography variant='paragraph-lg' align='left'>
    I'm left aligned! This is the default alignment.
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant='paragraph-lg' align='center'>
    I'm center aligned!
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant='paragraph-lg' align='right'>
    I'm right aligned!
  </Typography>
</Playground>

### The noWrap Prop

You can pass the noWrap prop and the text will not wrap and instead truncate with a text overflow ellipsis.

<Playground>
    <div style={{width:'15%'}}>
      <Typography variant='paragraph-lg' noWrap>
        This is what it's like to have noWrap on
      </Typography>
    </div>
</Playground>
